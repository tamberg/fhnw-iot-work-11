### a) Hello World Alexa skill, 15'
* Read the docs on getting started with [Alexa Skills Kit](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/ask-overviews/what-is-the-alexa-skills-kit.html).
* Try to understand the [components of a custom skill](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/understanding-custom-skills.html#components-of-a-custom-skill).
* See how the [Smart Home Skill API](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/smarthome/understand-the-smart-home-skill-api.html) simplifies this.
* [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYImJ2H__BY) on [testing and debugging](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/test/test-your-skill-overview.html) skills.
* Deploying requires an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/account/).

### b) Voice interaction design, 5'
* Imagine a simple voice controlled connected device.
* Find three use-cases and the corresponding _intents_.
* Write down two realistic _utterances_ for each intent.

### c) Use cases in context, 5'
* Come up with a use case for a _home_, _hotel_ & _hospital_.
* What changes with the context, what stays the same?
* Who is the user? What does the system (not) know?
* Who can see the data? How private is the data?
